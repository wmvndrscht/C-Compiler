Decided to keep a log of thoughts to help try to see my thinking as I evolve through the many paths of compiler approaches!!!!!!!!!!!

Before:
Title : Rolling in the Deep (Adele)
Moral : Yeah don't roll in the deep too much.
Thought about starting with a fairly complex function and building a 'simple parser + lexer + translater' from this, turns out I was even thinking of evaluation :O so yeah....so thoughts included
1. Evaulation of binding parameters from declaration list
2. Creating classes for everything in my parser EVEN EVERY non-terminal
3. Gettting mindf$$ked by overcomplicating everything basically
4. Traced through the whole AST as per the C89 draft
5. Asked people for advice

Title : Started from the Bottom now I'm here (Drake)
Moral : Build the roots before fiddling with leaves, but good to think a little about the leaves
Yes, DT is correct, start simple, start testing, get going, get momentum
How about start with external declaration int x; ?
Also develop testbench with this as well :)
