Decided to keep a log of thoughts to help try to see my thinking as I evolve through the many paths of compiler approaches!!!!!!!!!!!

Before:

Title : Rolling in the Deep (Adele)

Moral : Yeah don't roll in the deep too much.

Thought about starting with a fairly complex function and building a 'simple parser + lexer + translater' from this, turns out I was even thinking of evaluation :O so yeah....so thoughts included
1. Evaulation of binding parameters from declaration list
2. Creating classes for everything in my parser EVEN EVERY non-terminal
3. Gettting mindf$$ked by overcomplicating everything basically
4. Traced through the whole AST as per the C89 draft
5. Asked people for advice

Title : Started from the Bottom now I'm here (Drake)

Moral : Build the roots before fiddling with leaves, but good to think a little about the leaves

Yes, DT is correct, start simple, start testing, get going, get momentum
How about start with external declaration int x; ?
Also develop testbench with this as well :)

Title: So Clear (Junip)

Moral: Started simple makes things clearer

Good start now, just need to fix some compiler errors in order for simple 
thing to get going

Title: Highway to Hell (ACDC)

Moral: Get used to obscure bugs making your efficiency 1/100th of what you planned

Yeah........hit hard by stupid bugs and not very helpful error messages :-)
Luckily I jumped off the highway in the evening having fixed the bugs,
getting lexer, parser etc working!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Title: Mojo Pin

Moral: Tough to pin a mojo for this repitition here, possibly a partner
would be nice so repitition is lowered slightly, do I prefer ideas then 
asking others to execute?

Soooo....finished mvp for c translate equivalent of python formative,
now to get py_translate to work.....interestingly brings back more added 
functionality for files etc, ahhhh headaches to remember this stuff....oh 
well once structure is in place it's so easy to use just like testbench :)
Do I add NULL and keep classes generic, do I do more types of numbers 
or generic, we'll see ;)

Title: Moon (Kid Rancescoli)

Moral : Get through the atmosphere (codegen initial structure) 
as hard and long as it takes. I'm learning a lot and improving, it's fun
but every corner comes another great challenge, only 4 weeks left though :)


Python---:
After submitting the Python formative with reasonable success, it seems 
I am currently on track - let's keep it this way. My structure definitely
needs improving as feedback from fyq and dt, simple changes like splitting
declarations, statements etc instead of flat nodeptr. 
Next Steps---: Tidy up python environment and edge cases if(1) if()
if() else() etc

C_CODEGEN---:
Hmmm....yes getting the foundations and thinking is hard work, but that's
where the fun lies. It will take a while and some complex things to get
the foundations laid.
Next Steps-------: Ensure I can build context well and instructions etc
nicely. Get things working, then clean (python and test_cases) then advance.
