C Compiler
==============================

ANSI C89 to MIPS Assembly compiler and C to Python translator. 

I implemented a subset of the C89 spec including the core functionality:
- local variables
- integer arithmetic
- while, if, else conditions
- for loops
- function calls
- multidimensional arrays

Written in C++, using Flex for the Lexer and Bison for the Parser. 

This was a really fun solo project to get to understand compilers better.
